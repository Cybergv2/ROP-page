     <h2>Sing Along With The Theme Song</h2>
     <p>I wanna be the very best<br />
     Like no one ever was<br />
     To catch them is my real test<br />
     To train them is my cause<br/>
     I will travel across the land<br />
      Searchin' far and wide<br />
    Each Pokemon to understand<br />
    The power that's inside! (Power inside!)<br />
    <br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    It's you and me.<br />
    I know it's my destiny!<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    Ooh you're my best friend<br />
    In a world we must defend!<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    A heart so true<br />
    Our courage will pull us through<br />
    You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    (Gotta catch 'em) Gotta catch 'em Gotta catch 'em all!<br />
    <br />
    Every challenge along the way<br />
    With courage I will face<br />
    I will battle everyday<br />
    To claim my rightful place!<br />
    Come with me, the time is right!<br />
    There's no better team<br/>
    Arm and arm, we'll win the fight!<br />
    It's always been a dream!<br />
    <br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    It's you and me.<br />
    I know it's my destiny!<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    Ooh you're my best friend<br />
    In a world we must defend!<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    A heart so true<br />
    Our courage will pull us through<br />
    You teach me and I'll teach you<br />
    Pokemon!<br />
    (Gotta catch 'em) Gotta catch 'em (Pokemon!)<br />
    <br />
